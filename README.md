# Lower-Back-Pain-Prediction

In this project, the goal is to be able to apply the various classification models I have learnt and do a comparision to identify the best model to predict a normal/abnormal back. The dataset is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sammy123/lower-back-pain-symptoms-dataset">Kaggle.</a>

In this notebook, I will first be doing an EDA to gather more insights on the dataset I am working with, and perform some data preprocessing on it. Subsequently, I will be building my models to perform the prediction task and evaluating the models afterwards.

The models that I will be building comprise of 3 main parts:
1. Without dimensionality reduction
2. With dimensionality reduction
3. Deep learning using ANN
